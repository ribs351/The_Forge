  "description" : "[h1]This mod is still under construction, updates will be rolling out once I have spare time[/h1]\n\n(Thumbnail is also placeholder)\n\nSo what does this do?\n\nWell... \n\nAbout a year ago, I made two mods: \"The REAL protector's broadsword\" and \"The Preserver's Broadsword\" and uploaded them to the workshop. One is my submission to the starbound's subreddit's Custom Weapon Contest and the other was a reskinned protector's broadsword. They both have the same custom combos, altered stats, [b]overriding vanilla content, half-a$$ed sprites and swooshes[/b].\n\nBecause of their vanilla overriding nature, you can not have those two weapons at once, which is really dumb on my part, but back then I didn't know any better. One day I got really tired of looking at them and that's just it, it's time for a remaster, and this mod was it. The two mods mentioned is permanently deleted from the steam workshop, because I will no longer support them.\n\nSo... What's different in this mod?\n\nWell, this mod currently features:\n[list]\n[*] An upgraded version of the Protector's Broadsword: Faithkeeper's Broadsword. Obtainable via crafting through the Manipulator's table.\n[*] Remastered combo: still the same combo as the old mod, but with minor alterations and [b]ACTUAL COLORED SWOOSH SPRITES INSTEAD OF HUESHIFTED ONES!![/b]\n[*] Reworked flying slash projectiles: gives you 5 seconds of fast regen, god mode and 10 seconds of slow regenation afterwards\n[*] [strike]memes[/strike]\n[/list]\n\nPlanned features:\n[list]\n[*] New weapon: The corrupted broadsword. Stolen from the Terrene Protectorate, corrupted by the Occasus Cult. This sword now carries the ruins with it. (Yes, this will also get its own combos)\n[*] Upgradability: Weapons will be upgradable via the Weapon Upgrade Anvil, in a future update.\n[*] The ability to have both swords in your inventory at the same time. WHY CHOOSE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE BOTH?\n[/list]\n\nWhy is everything a placeholder? Because I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT AND IT'S STILL NOT FINISHED! This mod was supposed to include the corrupted broadsword, but since I'm a skrub, it has to be delayed.\n\nWhat's this \"Forge\" thing?\n\nIt's a mini-series of weapons and stuff that I plan on working. We do have a [url=https://discord.gg/2M5Xgf]discord server[/url] for those whom are interested.\n\nIf there's any questions, ask them in the comments below.\n\n/spawnitem faithkeeperbroadsword\n\nPS: If you wanna see how the [b]unfinished[/b] corrupted broadsword looks like in its current state, you can spawn it in as well. \n/spawnitem corruptedbroadsword\n\nCredits:\nMe - Coding, compiling\nSteven Steel - Corrupted Broadsword's sprites\nChuckfish - Creating Starbound and most of the assets that I'm using\nPhotoloss - I copied your tentacle fist projectiles because I thought it was cool, pls don't sue me :c",
